# Recording Function Fix

## Problem
The original recording function was creating HTML files instead of proper video files when stopping the recording. This was due to the system falling back to HTML playback when video creation failed.

## Solution
I've completely rewritten the recording system to create actual video files using the MediaRecorder API more effectively. Here are the key improvements:

### 1. Improved Video Creation
- **Direct Video Recording**: The system now uses MediaRecorder API to create actual video files (WebM, MP4, or OGG format)
- **Canvas-based Recording**: Frames are drawn to a canvas and streamed directly to MediaRecorder
- **Multiple Format Support**: Automatically detects and uses the best supported video format

### 2. Better Error Handling
- **Graceful Fallbacks**: If MediaRecorder fails, the system falls back to creating video from captured frames
- **Permission Handling**: Better handling of tab capture permissions and rate limits
- **Status Updates**: Clear status messages throughout the recording process

### 3. Enhanced Architecture
- **Offscreen Page**: Recording happens in an offscreen page to avoid content script limitations
- **Background Script Coordination**: Better communication between content script and background script
- **Frame Management**: Improved frame capture and processing

## How to Use

### 1. Activate the Simulator
- Click the extension icon to activate the device simulator
- Select a device from the toolbar

### 2. Start Recording
- Click the record button (red circle) in the toolbar
- The button will turn red and show "Stop Recording"
- A status message will appear showing recording progress

### 3. Stop Recording
- Click the record button again to stop recording
- The system will process the recording and automatically download a video file
- The file will be named `mockup-recording-YYYY-MM-DD-HH-MM-SS.webm` (or .mp4/.ogg)

## Technical Details

### Supported Video Formats
- WebM with VP9 codec (preferred)
- WebM with VP8 codec
- WebM (generic)
- MP4
- OGG

### Recording Settings
- **Frame Rate**: 2 FPS (frames per second)
- **Quality**: 2 Mbps bitrate
- **Format**: Automatically selects the best supported format

### File Output
- **Format**: Actual video files (not HTML)
- **Naming**: `mockup-recording-{timestamp}.{extension}`
- **Location**: Downloads folder (browser default)

## Troubleshooting

### If recording doesn't start:
1. Make sure the simulator is active
2. Check browser console for error messages
3. Ensure you have permission to capture the tab
4. Try refreshing the page if you get permission errors

### If recording can't be stopped:
1. The system has a 5-minute timeout that will automatically stop recording
2. Try refreshing the page if the stop button doesn't work
3. Check browser console for error messages

### If you get tab capture errors:
1. Click the record button again to grant permissions
2. Make sure the tab is active and visible
3. Try refreshing the page if you get "Cannot access contents" errors
4. The system will automatically retry with longer delays for rate limit issues

### If video creation fails:
1. The system will automatically fall back to creating video from frames
2. Check that your browser supports MediaRecorder API
3. Try refreshing the page and starting again

### Common Error Messages:
- **"activeTab permission not in effect"**: Click the record button again to grant permissions
- **"Cannot access tab contents"**: Refresh the page and try again
- **"No window with id"**: Refresh the page and try again (window was closed)
- **"Tab no longer exists"**: Refresh the page and try again (tab was closed)
- **"Rate limit exceeded"**: Wait a moment and try again (system will auto-retry)
- **"Could not establish connection"**: Refresh the page and restart recording
- **"No video data recorded"**: System will automatically try fallback method

## Files Modified

- `src/offscreen/recording.js` - Complete rewrite of recording logic
- `src/content/index.js` - Updated to use improved recording system
- `src/background/index.js` - Enhanced message handling for recording

## Build Instructions

To build the extension with the fixes:

```bash
cd nakawExt/react-clone
npm run build
```

The built extension will be in the `dist/` folder and can be loaded into Chrome as an unpacked extension.
