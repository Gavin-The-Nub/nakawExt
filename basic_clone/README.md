# Basic Clone Extension - Fixed Version

This is a simplified version of the mobile device simulator extension with fixes for CSS and scrollbar functionality.

## Fixed Issues

### 1. CSS Accuracy for Phone Models
- **Problem**: The CSS wasn't being applied correctly to make content look like it's inside the device mockup
- **Solution**: Improved the simulator implementation with:
  - Better mockup container styling with rounded corners and shadows
  - Proper iframe positioning under the mockup image
  - Enhanced overlay styling for better visual presentation
  - Added pointer-events handling to prevent mockup image from blocking interactions

### 2. Scrollbar Functionality
- **Problem**: Scrollbar toggle wasn't working properly - content wasn't scrolling
- **Solution**: Fixed the `applyScrollbar` function with:
  - Correct CSS logic for showing/hiding scrollbars
  - Proper webkit scrollbar styling when enabled
  - Complete scrollbar hiding when disabled
  - Better CSS injection targeting all frames
